    """Interactive authentication with iRODS server.

    The main difference with using the :class:`ibridges.Session` object directly is
    that it will ask for your password if the cached password does not exist or is outdated.
    This can be more secure, since you won't have to store the password in a file or notebook.
    Caches the password in ~/.irods/.irodsA upon success.

    Parameters
    ----------
    password:
        Password to make the connection with. If not supplied, you will be asked interactively.
    irods_env_path:
        Path to the irods environment.
    irodsa_backup:
        Backup of the .irodsA file to be used in case authentication fails.
    kwargs:
        Extra parameters for the interactive auth. Mainly used for the cwd parameter.

    Raises
    ------
    FileNotFoundError:
        If the irods_env_path does not exist.
    ValueError:
        If the connection to the iRods server cannot be established.

    Returns
    -------
        A connected session to the server.
