Welcome to the iBridges documentation!
======================================

`iBridges <https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/iBridges>`__ is a Python library to connect to iRods servers in a simplified and safe manner.

.. admonition:: Warning

   The project (including documentation) is currently in active development at a pre-alpha stage, which means that some functionality may be
   broken or not implemented yet. We appreciate help, issues and bug report in our issue tracker on `github <https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/iBridges>`__.


iBridges is a wrapper around the `python-irodsclient <https://github.com/irods/python-irodsclient>`__. While the
python-irodsclient is very powerful and feature rich, we aim to provide an easier API for users (mainly researchers)
that do not have any technical knowledge of iRods.
